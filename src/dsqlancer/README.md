# DSQLancer

DSQLancer (Domain-Specific Language for SQLancer) is an attempt to offer an easy way to adapt SQLancer to different target DBMSs with different SQL dialects.

It is a work-in-progress grammar-based fuzzer that generates test cases from ANTLR grammar files.

This work is an attempt to integrate the [Grammarinator](https://github.com/renatahodovan/grammarinator) methodology into SQLancer.
