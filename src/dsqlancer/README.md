# DSQLancer

DSQLancer (Domain-Specific Language for SQLancer) is an attempt to offer an easy way to adapt SQLancer to different target DBMSs with different SQL dialects.

It is a grammar-based fuzzer that generates test cases from ANTLR grammar files.

This work is heavily inspired by Grammarinator.
